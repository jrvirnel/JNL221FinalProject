        <p> <strong> SYRACUSE </strong> - Election costs have drastically increased in recent years, and they only seem to be increasing as the years pass. </p>

        <p>The 2020 campaign cycle broke records, with campaign costs almost doubling those of previous years. As the 2022 congressional and 2024 presidential cycles come closer, the record seems like it will be broken once again.</p>

        <p>The increase in campaign spending can be contributed to multiple factors, said Devin Howell, a previous Campaign Field Organizer for New York State Senator Mannion. Howell now works as Senator Mannion’s Legislative Correspondent. </p>

      </div>

        <p> “PACs, especially the use of super PACs, have increased throughout the years,” said Howell. <p>

        <p> PAC Financial Activity was at a standstill until 2010 when spending began to skyrocket, and has not slowed since. </p>

        <p> The increase in spending from PACs can be attributed to the Supreme Court decision in <a href="https://www.fec.gov/legal-resources/court-cases/citizens-united-v-fec/">Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission </a> on January 21, 2010. This decision overruled the outcome of a previous Supreme Court case called <a href= "https://www.fec.gov/legal-resources/court-cases/austin-v-michigan-state-chamber-of-commerce/">Austin v. Michigan State Chamber of Commerce </a>, which allowed spending limits to be enacted for big corporations on elections. </p>

        <p> In the court’s opinion, Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote that restricting “inde­pend­ent polit­ical spend­ing” is a violation of the nation’s First Amendment rights. This ruling overturned spending restrictions that had been in place for <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/citizens-united-explained">over 100 years </a> and drastically changed the course of elections and their futures.</p>

        <p>Corporations now have the ability to spend endless amounts of funds on campaigns, as long as they are not in contact with the campaign or the candidate, said Devin. These are called super PACs. According to <a href= "https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/top-pacs/2020"> Open Secrets</a>, some of the highest spending PACs in 2020 were the Senate Leadership Fund, Senate Majority PAC, and the Congressional Leadership Fund. </p>

        <p>Television advertisements and other forms of media advertising account for most of the campaign spending costs and increase each election year.“There are more television spots that are political than ever before,” said New York State Senator John Mannion, “Media is also more political than ever before".</p>

      </div>

        <p> In the 2019-2020 election cycles, political advertising spending reached around <a href="https://adage.com/article/campaign-trail/political-ad-spending-year-reached-whopping-85-billion/2295646">8.5 billion dollars</a>.</p>

        <p>Political advertisements can range from newspaper ads, billboards, flyers, TV presence, and so much more. These forms of mass communication help to reach a large audience and gain a candidate's traction recognition among voters.</p>

        <p>Erika Franklin Fowler, co-founder of the Wesleyan Media project said on a <a href=" https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/unprecedented-spending-for-2020-political-ads">PBS podcast </a> that television ads are used more as a persuasion tactic in campaigns, while digital ads are utilized more to encourage people to vote, stay informed, and donate to particular races.  </p>

        <p>The increase in advertisements in the 2020 election cycle represent how polarized the United States has come to be. As Fowler shared on PBS, “The things that we talk about, even when we're talking about local politics, are often much more about national conversations, about health care and other sorts of provision of things than they are necessarily about specific local issues.” </p>

        <h3><em><strong>“Americans did not have politics before 2016, and now we are learning how to be political,” </strong></h3> </em>

        <p>said Howell. </p>

        </div>

        <p>New York State Senator John Mannion shared some insight with me on his previous, and upcoming political campaigns. In 2018, Senator Mannion raised $250,000-$300,000. In 2020, the Senator raised $400,000-$450,000. For the next election, the Senator expects to raise at least $500,000. <p>

        <p>Certain costs for election campaigns are dedicated to finding a new office space and separate staff. Since it is illegal to perform campaign work in government office space, Senator Mannion, along with any other candidate running for office, must find separate office space and separate staff to hire. For some, this can be pricey and difficult to accomplish. </p>

        <p>Howell shared that as Senator Mannion remains in office for longer, he receives more and more individual donations from small donors. This is traditional for every incumbent said Howell.  </p>

        <p> Individual donations tend to make up a large percentage of a candidate's campaign funding. In 2020, donations from small donors more than doubled from previous years. </p>

        </script>

      </div>

      <div class="p1">

      <p> The rise in small donor contributions can be attributed to the United States’ polarization. As more and more individuals become involved in politics, they become increasingly motivated to donate to the campaigns they support. The rise in technology makes donating even easier than ever before, and can be done in one click. </p>

    </div>

      <p> Political campaign costs show no sign in slowing down. Candidates are utilizing the large donations they receive from super PACs and the abundant donations from small donors to fuel their campaign in areas like television and digital advertising. A polarized United States creates a society that is passionate about politics, and wants to get involved. This passion drives people engage in politics in any way they can, whether it be through protests, social media advocacy, or donations.  </p>
